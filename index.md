## About Me
My name is Nathan More and I am a game engineer currently working at Visual Concepts on some of the world's most popular sports titles. I studied game development at the University of California Irvine. In my free time I like to play video games (of course), mostly a mix of big RPGs and casual sim games. I also love hosting board game nights, watching movies in the theater, going on hikes, and reading comics.
### Tidbits
- I enjoy a wide variety of video games, from grand strategy games like Europa Universialis IV and Crusader Kings 3 to huge RPGs like The Witcher 3, and casual games like Slime Rancher. Some of my other favorite games of all time include Dishonored, Civilization V, God of War, Hades, Sid Meier's Pirates, and Portal 2.
- One of my favorite things about video games is emergent gameplay. Unlike many other mediums that can provide a great story, video games can create many unique and memorable experiences that speak to you individually.
- In college, I was the Design Director of the Video Game Development Club where I would host workshops on design topics.
- I specialize in C++ game development with experience in UI and Gameplay engineering.
- I have worked with Unreal, Unity, Godot, and multiple custom AAA game engines.
- Anyone who knows me well is aware of my infatuation with pizza in all forms, and my proportionately cruel affliction of lactose intolerance.
- Also, I love Dinosaurs (I have a cartoon T-Rex tattoo on my ankle).
